The data contains 4 folders. Inside the first folder are files containing the time and zonally averaged azimuthal velocities of all 24 models included in the study (see Table 2 in the publication), as well as the 1-d arrays for the radius and colatitude coordinates. The second folder contains further files for the reference case B1.1: the 3-d azimuthal velocity for the snapshot shown in figure 2 as well as the radial profiles of the velocity and magnetic field components shown in figure 4. The third and fourth folder include additional fields for cases B1.0 and B1.3 respectively, required for the magnetic field analysis, thermal wind balance and force balance plotting.
The format of the files is as follows:
- 3d: longitude, latitude, radius
- 2d: latitude, radius
- 1d: radius
