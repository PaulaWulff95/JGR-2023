The data contains 3 folders. Inside the folder "vpm" are files containing the time and zonally averaged azimuthal velocities of all 24 models included in the study (see Table 2 in the publication). Folder "B1.1" contains further files for the reference case B1.1: the azimuthal velocity for the snapshot shown in figure 2 on two radial levels (surface and bottom of convective region) and a slice along 0 longitude, as well as the radial profiles of the velocity and magnetic field components shown in figure 4.  The folder "B1.0-B1.3" includes additional fields for cases B1.0 and B1.3 respectively, required for the magnetic field analysis, thermal wind balance and force balance plotting, as well as the 1-d array for the radius coordinate.
The format of the files is as follows:
- 2d: latitude, radius
- 1d: radius
